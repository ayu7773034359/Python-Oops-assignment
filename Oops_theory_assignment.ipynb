        "\n",
        "   ->Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) offers several advantages that contribute to software development being more manageable, scalable, and maintainable. Here are some key advantages of OOP:\n",
        "\n",
        " -  Modularity\n",
        "OOP allows you to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts (objects). Each object encapsulates its data and behavior, which provides a clear structure to your code. This modularity makes it easier to organize and manage code, since each module (class/object) can be developed and tested independently.\n",
        "\n",
        " -  Code Reusability\n",
        "With OOP, you can create new classes that are based on existing classes (inheritance), allowing you to reuse code without duplicating it. This reduces redundancy and leads to more efficient and maintainable code. Additionally, features such as polymorphism enable generic programming, where methods can work with objects of different types.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Encapsulation\n",
        "Encapsulation allows you to hide the internal state and functionalities of an object from the outside world. This protects the integrity of the data by preventing external code from manipulating it directly, thereby reducing the risk of unintended interference. Access to the object's data and methods is controlled through public interfaces, which improves security and reduces complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Polymorphism\n",
        "Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This allows methods to take on different behaviors based on the object calling them, facilitating flexibility and dynamic behavior in your code. It simplifies code by allowing one interface to be used for multiple data types.\n",
